2  [AI-Powered Resume Screening Assistant](./Resume_Screening_AI)
**Description:**  
A practical **AI recruiter assistant** that scans candidate resumes and ranks them by relevance for a given job description.  
Demonstrates the ability to combine NLP and classification for recruitment automation.

3 Spam Call Classifier Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that detects spam vs non-spam (ham) messages from phone call transcripts or SMS text. This project includes a model training script and an interactive Streamlit web app interface for real-time predictions.

🔍 Features

1. Classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam
2 Interactive Streamlit Web App
3. Uses TF-IDF for text vectorization
4. Machine Learning model (Naive Bayes)
5. Real-time confidence score
6. Easy to extend with more data or models
